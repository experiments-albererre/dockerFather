# dockerFather
docker config to set website from git repository

## Main difference between RUN and CMD commands:

The RUN command just execute a command in terminal

The CMD is the MAIN COMMAND of the docker container, if this command finishes, the docker dies. As the docker container only runs when its main project is alive! (IMPORTANT!)
